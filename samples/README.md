# Samples directory

Here I'll be putting recorded samples of certain songs (or sometimes me playing the digital piano) numbered chronologically to hear how the project has been progressing over time. I'm not sure how legal or illegal it is to share samples of copyrighted music but if it is forbidden then just let me know.

All recordings are taken straight from my Pico and the only post-processing done is the amplification of the volume.
